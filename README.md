# space-website
A simple multi-page website about space, created as part of a university HTML/CSS assignment.

The website contains three static pages:
- Home page (general introduction to space)
- Planet overview page
- A gallery page with space-related images

Features:
- Simple layout using HTML and CSS
- Internal navigation between pages
- Use of lists, images, and basic formatting

Disclamer:
This is an early learning project. The layout and code quality are basic and do not reflect professional standards â€” but it demonstrates my first steps into frontend development.
